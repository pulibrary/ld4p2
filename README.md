# ld4p2

Princetonâ€™s proposal, as a cohort member, centers on the involvement of a wide range of staff in data creation mirroring their current day-to-day cataloging responsibilities. Our data creation for LD4P2 will have a strong emphasis on non-roman script materials. We expect to develop, test, document, and share workflows for our daily cataloging tasks using the cloud environment and editing tools. We will keep metrics on productivity, training needs, learning curve, and other aspects of operating in this new environment and assess them against current metrics.
